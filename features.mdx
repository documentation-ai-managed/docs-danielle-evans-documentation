## Document Organization

You create hierarchical structures to keep your documentation tidy. Use folders for top-level categories and tags for cross-referencing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Navigate to your workspace and select **New Folder**. Name it based on your project phase, such as `API Reference`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Tags" icon="tag">
    Open a document, click **Tags**, and add labels like `v2.0` or `internal`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Version Control" icon="git-branch">
    Enable versioning to track changes. Publish updates without losing history.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Callout kind="tip">

| Tag-Based | Filters by labels | `tag:v2.0` |
| Advanced | Date range + author | `after:2024-01-01 author:alice` |
